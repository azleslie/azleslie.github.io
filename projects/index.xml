      <description>Over the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a digital edition of James Russell Lowell&amp;rsquo;s poem A Fable for Critics, the sensational 1848 satire of American literature from Poe to Emerson to Cooper. In both its colorful content and its lively reception, A Fable for Critics is a snapshot of the antebellum literary scene, with all its boisterous wit, youthful pretensions, cliquish bits, bitter feuds, and nagging uncertainty over whether there really was &amp;ndash; or could be &amp;ndash; a uniquely American literature.</description>

      <description>Since the Spring 2018 semester I have served as the Digital Humanities Graduate Specialist for Rutgers Libraries. Over this time I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a number of workshops, from basic tutorials on using software popular among digital humanists (Gephi, Paladio, Tropy, etc.) to introductory and intermediate lessons on R programming in the humanities. The links each lead to a GitHub repository page, where you can find all the materials &amp;ndash; code, sample data, and step-by-step instructions &amp;ndash; for running the workshops on your own.</description>

      <description>I used the static site generator Hugo and GitHub Pages hosting to build this website. Aside from one or two mistakes on my end, it was relatively easy to learn, customize, and deploy. That said, I did have to do some guessing and hopping between not-always-forthright tutorials.1 In the interests of learning more and helping others avoid my mistakes, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone back through the process step by step here.2
