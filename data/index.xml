      <description>This is a CSV file of the basic metadata for the American Antiquarian Society&amp;rsquo;s Historical Periodicals Collection from 1821-1865, drawn from the EBSCO coverage lists.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made several improvements. First, I added geographic coordinates for publishing locations. Second, I eliminated some of the redundancy from the original files, though some remains. I wish that the genre field were more consistent and more consolidated, but I think the only way to do that would be to go through entry by entry.</description>
