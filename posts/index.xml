      <description>I decided to bite the bullet and make a website. I hope you like it.
You&amp;rsquo;ll find various professional materials collected here, complete with links and downloads. I also hope to use this site as a place to make available some of the datasets from my research and to share the occasional thought on materials or methods.
I wanted something that was minimalist in both aesthetics and organization so that I could keep the content local, get under the hood, and get a bit more experience with HTML, CSS, and the command line along the way.</description>
