      <title>Rural Newsprint Vocabulary Size</title>

      <description>I saw a recent tweet by Richard Dawkins repeat a silly anecdote that 19th century peasants had an average vocabulary of only 250 words. There are many ways to disprove this obvious falsehood.1 One way would be to look at linguistic materials that a particular demographic used. Newspapers were a key source of information and communication in the 19th century: they included a wide variety of content &amp;ndash; news, ads, entertainment, correspondence, domestic tips, etc.</description>

      <title>A Bloomsday Tour of Every Episode in Joyce&#39;s Ulysses</title>

      <description>Dublin is the heart of James Joyce&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece Ulysses, to such a degree that the day on which the novel takes place, June 16, has become a holiday known as &amp;ldquo;Bloomsday.&amp;rdquo; When I first visited the city in 2011, I wanted to do a one-day Ulysses walking tour by visiting a location from every episode in the novel. I was disappointed at the lack of guides online, so I assembled my own set of locations and optimal order.</description>

      <title>The Marginal Costs of Book Production</title>

      <description>What did it cost to make a book? Books are complex commodities, the product of multiple distinct trades and industrial processes. Most literary scholarship makes frustratingly vague gestures at this question, so I decided to calculate an average production costs breakdown for the trade publishing industry in the opening decades of the twentieth century.1
Figure 1 shows the average expenses for each aspect of manufacturing and printing, drawn from book cost cards for novels in the J.</description>

      <title>Winter was for Reading</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I wrote about seasonal and economic cycles in the publishing industry. This is a short addition on the relation between seasonal sales cycles and seasonal reading cycles.
Previously, I used data from the Stokes Company, a leading publisher of the early 20th century, to show how annual book sales peaked in the fall. From 1895 to 1902, 36% of Stokes&#39; sales occurred in October and November &amp;ndash; more than the seven months of January through July combined.</description>

      <title>Seasonal and Economic Cycles in Publishing</title>

      <description>Trade publishing &amp;ndash; general-interest books sold through retailers &amp;ndash; is a curious business. Narrative may be a necessity of life, but the book format as a commodity is not. Books have not been luxury items for the last hundred and fifty years: you could purchase them at department stores, drug stores, train stations, and news depots (so long as you weren&amp;rsquo;t too picky about what you were looking for). And yet, for the majority of consumers, books were not a regular purchase either.</description>

      <title>Patterns and Predictability in Borrower Behavior</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/borrower-predictability/</link>

      <description>Readers are idiosyncratic. Recent work with library data has underscored this fact more than ever, but it has also drawn attention to specific patterns in reading behavior &amp;ndash; many even unexpected. What, then, is the relation between borrowing patterns and borrower idiosyncrasy at the broader level of overall library use: across many patrons’ full borrowing history?
I had the pleasure of presenting on this subject at the excellent Library Circulation Histories Workshop over the past couple weeks.</description>

      <title>Howells Novels Ranking</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/howells-ranking/</link>

      <guid>https://azleslie.com/posts/howells-ranking/</guid>
      <description>American author William Dean Howells (1837-1920) wrote dozens of novels &amp;ndash; to say nothing of his equally influential editorial and critical output &amp;ndash; over a career whose longevity, acclaim, and broad dissemination can only really be compared today to that of (forgive me) someone like Stan Lee, Beyoncé, or the Simpsons. Consider: a reader of the four or five most recognized literary magazines from 1871 to 1890 would have encountered Howells&#39; fiction more months than not.</description>

      <title>Visual Effects in Literary Monthlies</title>

      <description>Literary monthlies &amp;ndash; the Atlantic, Harper’s, the Century, Lippincott’s, and Scribner’s &amp;ndash; were some of the most widely read and highly respected magazines in nineteenth-century America. They don&amp;rsquo;t usually strike one as avant garde today, but I think that’s a misunderstanding for several reasons. For one, literary monthlies helped drive the development of new technologies and skills for reproducing illustrations. But they also expanded the possibilities of what illustrations could do.</description>

      <title>How the Spanish Flu Went Viral (And Then Got Boring)</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/spanish-flu/</link>

      <description>What feels most modern about this pandemic &amp;ndash; the all-pervasive news coverage &amp;ndash; has a precedent in the 1918 Spanish flu that suggests why it’s already tapering.
Despite expert warnings that coronavirus repercussions will extend through summer, politicians aren’t the only ones wondering how much longer even partial lockdowns can last. The trouble isn’t just impatience. Almost two months after the cancellations of events and entertainment nationwide, the sheer inescapability of pandemic discourse raises the question of how much longer we can remain interested enough to follow its advice.</description>

      <title>News Rhythms</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/news-rhythms/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re quite familiar today with the idea of news cycles: the fluctuating window of time it takes for a full turnover of major news items. Underlying these variable, context-driven cycles are other, structural patterns of news making and circulating. These are what I like to call news rhythms.
The difference is partly a classic superstructure / base distinction in that many of the factors contributing to news rhythms are economic or industrial.</description>

      <title>New Site</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/new-site/</link>

      <description>I decided to bite the bullet and make a website. I hope you like it.
You&amp;rsquo;ll find various professional materials collected here, complete with links and downloads. I also hope to use this site as a place to make available some of the datasets from my research and to share occasional thoughts on whatever materials or methods happen to excite me at the moment.
As for the site itself, I wanted something that was minimalist in both aesthetics and organization in order to keep content local, get under the hood, and get more experience with HTML, CSS, and the command line along the way.</description>
