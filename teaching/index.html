	<p><strong>Re-Writing and Re-Fighting the Civil War</strong>
(358:442, Summer 2018)</p>
<p>As recent conflicts over Confederate monuments have shown, the American Civil War remains hotly contested over one hundred and fifty years after its conclusion: why did it begin? what did soldiers or politicians on either side fight for? what was the result? who really “won”? If even such fundamental questions as these seem unclear to so many people, it’s because the story of the Civil War has been retold so many times and for so many different reasons that the war itself has become less important than the stories we tell about it.</p>
<p>The Civil War was started by a book – or so we’re told Abraham Lincoln once said of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1853). Since before the dust of battle settled up to our present moment, the Civil War has been revisited as a means of debating racial equality, masculinity, government expansion, and economic inequality. Like the war started by a book, these new socio-political battles were spurred on first and foremost by art as well: film, music, painting, monuments, and, especially, literature. Past and present, cause and effect, fact and fiction begin to blur in the face of this complex cultural legacy. This class will explore how and why the Civil War was re-imagined and re-contested from 1860 to the present in order to understand the foundations of the stories we continue to tell about it – and fight over.</p>

<p><strong>The Cultural History of Now: Inequality–The New Gilded Age?</strong>
(Co-taught with Brad Evans, 358:275, Spring 2018)</p>
<p>Corporate capitalism and realist fiction came of age together in the nineteenth century. It thus seems fitting that, today, when commentators are looking to describe the inequality of twenty-first century capitalism, they often say that we have entered “a new gilded age,” a term originally coined by the American novelist Mark Twain. However, instead of realist novels, the favored modality of political discourse is now statistical, with graphs and datasets taking the place of plot lines and character studies. Most conspicuously, the “Occupy Wall Street” movement popularized the growing wealth gap by telling a story about the 1%, while a recent article in The Economist assures us that it’s not the 1% we need to worry about, but rather the .01%. This course is motivated by the statistical turn in in the contemporary story of inequality to reconsider of the older story told about inequality by nineteenth-century realism.</p>
<p>What happens when we go back to realist novels to tell the story of inequality? Perversely, we find ourselves in a world deeply scarred by unreality, by the fictiveness of evident social truths. Can a painting or a story ever be real? Does anyone really think there is such thing as truth in fiction? Isn’t the definition of fiction dependent on something like a lie? After all, we are talking about made-up novels and images on a canvas, not journalism, not history, not documentary. And then, what about the unreality of corporate capitalism and consumer culture? Doesn’t the very idea of a commodity entail a fiction, the consumption of a feeling or a mood as much as real thing? What is a corporation if not a kind of fiction, a legal entity standing in place of an owner?</p>
