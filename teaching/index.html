	<p><strong>Re-Writing and Re-Fighting the Civil War</strong>
(358:442, Summer 2018)</p>
<p>As recent conflicts over Confederate monuments have shown, the American Civil War remains hotly contested over one hundred and fifty years after its conclusion: why did it begin? what did soldiers or politicians on either side fight for? what was the result? who really “won”? If even such fundamental questions as these seem unclear to so many people, it’s because the story of the Civil War has been retold so many times and for so many different reasons that the war itself has become less important than the stories we tell about it.</p>
<p>The Civil War was started by a book – or so we’re told Abraham Lincoln once said of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1853). From its opening battles up to our present moment, the Civil War has been revisited as a means of debating racial equality, masculinity, government expansion, and economic inequality. Like the war started by a book, these new socio-political battles were spurred on first and foremost by art as well: film, music, painting, monuments, and, especially, literature. Past and present, cause and effect, fact and fiction begin to blur in the face of this complex cultural legacy. This class will explore how and why the Civil War was re-imagined and re-contested from 1860 to the present in order to understand the foundations of the stories we continue to tell about it – and fight over.</p>

<p><strong>The Cultural History of Now: Inequality–The New Gilded Age?</strong>
(Co-taught with Brad Evans. 358:275, Spring 2018)</p>
<hr class="sep">
<p><strong>Principles of Literature: Poetry</strong>
(359:201, Fall 2017 and Spring 2017)</p>
<p>All language is ambiguous, elusive, and multi-meaningful, whether it’s in the form of a book, real news, fake news, a quarterly report, or an everyday email. Most uses of language try to cover over this complexity. Literature, and poetry especially, is unique in that it puts these qualities common to all language center-stage. In this course, required for English majors but open to all, we will learn how poems work and read some of the very best ever written, from early modern sonnets to contemporary free verse. In the process we will also outline a timeline of art history. The poets of successive literary movements wrote differently out of different ideas about what poetry ought to be; similarly, successive generations read poetry for different reasons and in different contexts – many of which treated poems more like the way we treat pop songs or Instagram captions today. Much as understanding poetic form helps us recognize the workings of language more fully, understanding poetic history gives us intimate insight into each historical moment’s most fundamental beliefs and concerns. Perhaps just as importantly, knowing both form and history will ultimately enable you to enjoy poetry more.</p>

<p>One of the great pleasures of teaching this class is being asked for recommendations for further reading. To that end I&rsquo;ve assembled a short (and admittedly sometimes idiosyncratic) <a href="/poetry-further-reading.pdf">list of suggestions</a> to compliment what is covered in the course.</p>
<hr class="sep">
<p><strong>Expository Writing</strong>
(355:101, Spring 2016 and Fall 2015)</p>
<p>This introductory writing course, mandatory for all Rutgers students, teaches close, critical reading, synthetic thinking across multiple sources, and thesis-driven analytical writing. We will emphasize in particular maintaining the logical progression of claims and the continued development of ideas over the course of a paper. While this requires a degree of lecture-based instruction, group discussion of texts plays a central role as well. Furthermore, one of the main goals of the course is to teach focused and effective editing, both of one&rsquo;s own work and of one&rsquo;s peers&rsquo;.</p>
