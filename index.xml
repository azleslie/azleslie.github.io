      <title>Patterns and Predictability in Borrower Behavior</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/borrower-predictability/</link>

      <description>Readers are idiosyncratic. Recent work with library data has underscored this fact more than ever, but it has also drawn attention to specific patterns in reading behavior &amp;ndash; many even unexpected. What, then, is the relation between borrowing patterns and borrower idiosyncrasy at the broader level of overall library use: across many patrons’ full borrowing history?
I had the pleasure of presenting on this subject at the excellent Library Circulation Histories Workshop over the past couple weeks.</description>

      <title>Lowell&#39;s A Fable for Critics Digital Edition</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/projects/fable-edition/</link>

      <description>Over the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a digital edition of James Russell Lowell&amp;rsquo;s poem A Fable for Critics, the sensational 1848 satire of American literature from Poe to Emerson to Cooper. In both its colorful content and its lively reception, A Fable for Critics is a snapshot of the antebellum literary scene, with all its boisterous wit, youthful pretensions, cliquish bits, bitter feuds, and nagging uncertainty over whether there really was &amp;ndash; or could be &amp;ndash; a uniquely American literature.</description>

      <description>I am a Bevier Fellow in the English Department at Rutgers University, where I defended my PhD in 2021. I specialize in American cultural history from the Early Republic to Modernism, with particular focus on circulation and reception, cultural geography, genre, and digital humanities.
My book project, &amp;ldquo;Reading Regions: Cultural Geography and American Literature, 1852-1925,&amp;rdquo; combines literary, historical, and quantitative analysis to argue that the emergence of a nationally-incorporated cultural field in America galvanized regional differences rather than subsuming them.</description>

      <title>Postbellum Newspaper Syndicates</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/data/newspaper-syndicates/</link>

      <guid>https://azleslie.com/data/newspaper-syndicates/</guid>
      <description>This dataset represents the newspapers served by the five leading syndicates of the postbellum period. Syndicates fueled the rapid growth of the American press after the Civil War by providing cheap content &amp;ndash; not only news but literary entertainment, general information, and illustrations &amp;ndash; to fledgling editors and to newspapers in communities that otherwise would have been too small to sustain one. They exerted profound influence on the format itself and on what millions of Americans read, especially in rural areas.</description>

      <title>Howells Novels Ranking</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/howells-ranking/</link>

      <guid>https://azleslie.com/posts/howells-ranking/</guid>
      <description>American author William Dean Howells (1837-1920) wrote dozens of novels &amp;ndash; to say nothing of his equally influential editorial and critical output &amp;ndash; over a career whose longevity, acclaim, and broad dissemination can only really be compared today to that of (forgive me) someone like Stan Lee, Beyoncé, or the Simpsons. Consider: a reader of the four or five most recognized literary magazines from 1871 to 1890 would have encountered Howells&#39; fiction more months than not.</description>

      <description>Since the Spring 2018 semester I have served as the Digital Humanities Graduate Specialist for Rutgers Libraries. Over this time I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a number of workshops, from basic tutorials on using software popular among digital humanists (Gephi, Paladio, Tropy, etc.) to introductory and intermediate lessons on R programming in the humanities. The links each lead to a GitHub repository page, where you can find all the materials &amp;ndash; code, sample data, and step-by-step instructions &amp;ndash; for running the workshops on your own.</description>

      <title>North American Bookstores, 1915</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/data/booksellers1915/</link>

      <guid>https://azleslie.com/data/booksellers1915/</guid>
      <description>This dataset is a near-comprehensive record of bookstores and dedicated booksellers in the U.S. and Canada in 1915, compiled by Publishers&#39; Weekly.1 Though Americans had several non-storefront sources of books (including mail order and subscription), this dataset gives insight into the locations, volume, and types of stores from which Americans could purchase books in the early 20th century.
The Publishers&#39; Weekly directory primarily consists of American booksellers, but it includes a significant number of Canadian booksellers as well as a few in Cuba, Mexico, and the Philippines.</description>

      <title>Newspaper Directory Advertiser Annotations</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/data/cook76-directory-annotations/</link>

      <guid>https://azleslie.com/data/cook76-directory-annotations/</guid>
      <description>This is a small and unusual dataset, but it&amp;rsquo;s one that I like and learned a fair bit from: an advertiser&amp;rsquo;s annotations of a 1876 edition of C. A. Cook &amp;amp; Co.&amp;rsquo;s United States Newspaper Directory now held at the American Antiquarian Society.1
Newspaper agencies were a major go-between for advertisers and periodicals in the postbellum period, promising advertisers less hassle and publishers more reliable ad revenue streams. By the mid-1870s they published annual directories of the country&amp;rsquo;s newspapers, usually with a short record of political affiliation, genre, publisher, estimated circulation, and even short descriptions of the local population, all to help businesses choose where to place their ads.</description>

      <title>Visual Effects in Literary Monthlies</title>

      <description>Literary monthlies &amp;ndash; the Atlantic, Harper’s, the Century, Lippincott’s, and Scribner’s &amp;ndash; were some of the most widely read and highly respected magazines in nineteenth-century America. They don&amp;rsquo;t usually strike one as avant garde today, but I think that’s a misunderstanding for several reasons. For one, literary monthlies helped drive the development of new technologies and skills for reproducing illustrations. But they also expanded the possibilities of what illustrations could do.</description>

      <title>How the Spanish Flu Went Viral (And Then Got Boring)</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/spanish-flu/</link>

      <guid>https://azleslie.com/posts/spanish-flu/</guid>
      <description>What feels most modern about this pandemic &amp;ndash; the all-pervasive news coverage &amp;ndash; has a precedent in the 1918 Spanish flu that suggests why it’s already tapering.
Despite expert warnings that coronavirus repercussions will extend through summer, politicians aren’t the only ones wondering how much longer even partial lockdowns can last. The trouble isn’t just impatience. Almost two months after the cancellations of events and entertainment nationwide, the sheer inescapability of pandemic discourse raises the question of how much longer we can remain interested enough to follow its advice.</description>

      <description>I used the static site generator Hugo and GitHub Pages hosting to build this website. Aside from one or two mistakes on my end, it was relatively easy to learn, customize, and deploy. That said, I did have to do some guessing and hopping between not-always-forthright tutorials.1 In the interests of learning more and helping others avoid my mistakes, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone back through the process step by step here.2

      <title>News Rhythms</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/news-rhythms/</link>

      <guid>https://azleslie.com/posts/news-rhythms/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re quite familiar today with the idea of news cycles: the fluctuating window of time it takes for a full turnover of major news items. Underlying these variable, context-driven cycles are other, structural patterns of news making and circulating. These are what I like to call news rhythms.
The difference is partly a classic superstructure / base distinction in that many of the factors contributing to news rhythms are economic or industrial.</description>

      <description>Re-Writing and Re-Fighting the Civil War (358:442, Summer 2018; Syllabus)
As recent conflicts over Confederate monuments have shown, the American Civil War remains hotly contested over one hundred and fifty years after its conclusion: why did it begin? what did soldiers or politicians on either side fight for? what was the result? who really “won”? If even such fundamental questions as these seem unclear to so many people, it’s because the story of the Civil War has been retold so many times and for so many different reasons that the war itself has become less important than the stories we tell about it.</description>

      <description>Peer Reviewed &amp;ldquo;Race, Region, and the Black Midwest in the Dunbar Decades,&amp;rdquo; forthcoming in American Literary History (2022).
In this essay I show how Paul Laurence Dunbar, today most associated with plantation poetry, successfully utilized Midwestern identity as an alternative site for Black expression and cultural affiliation. Writing in Midwestern dialects and tropes, Dunbar was able to become widely recognized as a Midwestern writer and in doing so compel white readers to place regional belonging over racial alterity as a framework for interpreting cultural difference even at the height of Jim Crow.</description>

      <title>Antebellum Periodicals Metadata</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/data/antebellum-periodicals/</link>

      <description>This is a CSV file of the basic metadata for the American Antiquarian Society&amp;rsquo;s Historical Periodicals Collection from 1821-1865, drawn from the EBSCO coverage lists.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made several improvements. First, I added geographic coordinates for publishing locations. Second, I eliminated some of the redundancy from the original files, though some remains. I wish that the genre field were more consistent and more consolidated, but I think the only way to do that would be to go through entry by entry.</description>

      <title>New Site</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/new-site/</link>

      <guid>https://azleslie.com/posts/new-site/</guid>
      <description>I decided to bite the bullet and make a website. I hope you like it.
You&amp;rsquo;ll find various professional materials collected here, complete with links and downloads. I also hope to use this site as a place to make available some of the datasets from my research and to share occasional thoughts on whatever materials or methods happen to excite me at the moment.
As for the site itself, I wanted something that was minimalist in both aesthetics and organization in order to keep content local, get under the hood, and get more experience with HTML, CSS, and the command line along the way.</description>
