      <title>North American Booksellers, 1915</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/data/booksellers1915/</link>

      <description>This dataset is a near-comprehensive record of dedicated booksellers in the U.S. and Canada in 1915, compiled by Publishers&amp;rsquo; Weekly.1 Though Americans had several non-storefront sources of books (including mail order and subscription), this dataset gives insight into the locations, volume, and types of stores from which Americans could purchase books in the Progressive Era.
The Publishers&amp;rsquo; Weekly directory primarily consists of American booksellers, but it includes a significant number of Canadian booksellers as well as a few in Cuba, Mexico, and the Philippines.</description>

      <title>Newspaper Directory Advertiser Annotations</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/data/cook76-directory-annotations/</link>

      <description>This is a small and unusual dataset, but it&amp;rsquo;s one that I like and learned a fair bit from: an advertiser&amp;rsquo;s annotations of a 1876 edition of C. A. Cook &amp;amp; Co.&amp;lsquo;s United States Newspaper Directory now held at the American Antiquarian Society.1
Newspaper agencies were a major go-between for advertisers and periodicals in the postbellum period, promising advertisers less hassle and publishers more reliable ad revenue streams. By the mid-1870s they published annual directories of the country&amp;rsquo;s newspapers, usually with a short record of political affiliation, genre, publisher, estimated circulation, and even short descriptions of the local population, all to help businesses choose where to place their ads.</description>

      <title>Visual Effects in Literary Monthlies</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/literary-monthlies-illustrations/</link>

      <description>Literary monthlies &amp;ndash; the Atlantic, Harper’s, the Century, Lippincott’s, and Scribner’s &amp;ndash; were some of the most widely read and highly respected magazines in nineteenth-century America. They don&amp;rsquo;t usually strike one as avant garde today, but I think that’s a misunderstanding for several reasons. For one, literary monthlies helped drive the development of new technologies and skills for reproducing illustrations. But they also expanded the possibilities of what illustrations could do.</description>

      <description>I am a Bevier Fellow and PhD candidate in the English Department at Rutgers University. I specialize in American cultural history from the Early Republic to Modernism, with particular focus on circulation and reception, cultural geography, genre, and digital humanities methods.
My dissertation, &amp;ldquo;Reading Regions: Cultural Geography and American Literature, 1865-1925,&amp;rdquo; argues that region was not simply a framework for representing cultural difference but a structuring principle of the cultural field.</description>

      <title>How the Spanish Flu Went Viral (And Then Got Boring)</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/spanish-flu/</link>

      <description>What feels most modern about this pandemic &amp;ndash; the all-pervasive news coverage &amp;ndash; has a precedent in the 1918 Spanish flu that suggests why it’s already tapering.
Despite expert warnings that coronavirus repercussions will extend through summer, politicians aren’t the only ones wondering how much longer even partial lockdowns can last. The trouble isn’t just impatience. Almost two months after the cancellations of events and entertainment nationwide, the sheer inescapability of pandemic discourse raises the question of how much longer we can remain interested enough to follow its advice.</description>

      <title>Hugo and GitHub Pages Tutorial</title>

      <description>I used the static site generator Hugo and GitHub Pages hosting to build this website. Aside from one or two mistakes on my end, it was relatively easy to learn, customize, and deploy. That said, I did have to do some guessing and hopping between not-always-forthright tutorials.1 In the interests of learning a bit more and potentially helping others avoid my mistakes, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone back through the process step by step here.</description>

      <title>Digital Humanities Workshops</title>

      <description>Since the Spring 2018 semester I have served as the Digital Humanities Graduate Specialist for Rutgers Libraries. Over this time I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a number of workshops, from basic tutorials on using software popular among digital humanists (Gephi, Paladio, Tropy, etc.) to some introductory and intermediate lessons on R programming in the humanities. The links each lead to a GitHub repository page, where you can find all the materials &amp;ndash; code, sample data, and step-by-step instructions &amp;ndash; for running the workshops on your own.</description>

      <title>News Rhythms</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/news-rhythms/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re quite familiar today with the idea of news cycles: the fluctuating window of time it takes for a full turnover of major news items. Underlying these variable, context-driven cycles are other, structural patterns of news making and circulating. These are what I like to call news rhythms.
The difference is partly a classic superstructure / base distinction in that many of the factors contributing to news rhythms are economic or industrial.</description>

      <description>Re-Writing and Re-Fighting the Civil War (358:442, Summer 2018)
As recent conflicts over Confederate monuments have shown, the American Civil War remains hotly contested over one hundred and fifty years after its conclusion: why did it begin? what did soldiers or politicians on either side fight for? what was the result? who really “won”? If even such fundamental questions as these seem unclear to so many people, it’s because the story of the Civil War has been retold so many times and for so many different reasons that the war itself has become less important than the stories we tell about it.</description>

      <description>Peer Reviewed &amp;ldquo;Regional Nationalism and the Ends of the Literary World,&amp;rdquo; J19: the Journal of Nineteenth-Century Americanists 7.2 (Fall 2019): 249-275. Download here.
In this essay I examine the Literary World, the influential literary periodical edited by Evert Duyckinck, to rethink the relationship between region and nation in antebellum cultural geography. I argue that there were multiple literary nationalisms, each a regionally distinctive invocation of nationalist rhetoric on behalf of regional interests that belied rather than represented or advocated a national literature.</description>

      <title>Antebellum Periodicals Metadata</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/data/antebellum-periodicals/</link>

      <description>This is a CSV file of the basic metadata for the American Antiquarian Society&amp;rsquo;s Historical Periodicals Collection from 1821-1865, drawn from the EBSCO coverage lists.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made several improvements. First, I added geographic coordinates for publishing locations. Second, I eliminated some of the redundancy from the original files, though some remains. I wish that the genre field were more consistent and more consolidated, but I think the only way to do that would be to go through entry by entry.</description>

      <title>New Site</title>
      <link>https://azleslie.com/posts/new-site/</link>

      <description>I decided to bite the bullet and make a website. I hope you like it.
You&amp;rsquo;ll find various professional materials collected here, complete with links and downloads. I also hope to use this site as a place to make available some of the datasets from my research and to share occasional thoughts on whatever materials or methods happen to excite me at the moment.
As for the site itself, I wanted something that was minimalist in both aesthetics and organization in order to keep content local, get under the hood, and get more experience with HTML, CSS, and the command line along the way.</description>
